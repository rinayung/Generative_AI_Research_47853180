## Collaboration

This project is organized to support teamwork. If you want to add or update files,
please follow these rules:

1. **File Naming**
   - Use clear names: `AuthorYear_Topic.pdf` for references,  
     `Interview_Name_Date_v1.docx` for transcripts,  
     `SurveyData_Cleaned_YYYYMMDD.csv` for data.
   - Avoid names like `final_final2` or `new data`.

2. **Folder Structure**
   - Do not create random folders. Put files into the right folder:
     - `Literature Review/reference/` → papers and PDFs
     - `Drafts and Report/` → proposals, drafts, reports
     - `Qualitative Analysis/Interviews_Transcript/` → interview docs
     - `Quantitative Analysis/SurveyData/` → survey data and analysis code
     - `Additional Materials/Figures/` → images, figures

3. **Commits**
   - Write short messages in English, e.g.:
     - `rename survey files`
     - `add interview transcript`
     - `update draft report`

4. **Working Together**
   - If you edit the same file, please rename with version number (v1, v2) to avoid conflict.
   - Use `README.md` to explain any important changes.
